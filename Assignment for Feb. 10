Assignment for Feb. 10

      I think it would be interesting to do reporting using data from the Maryland Department of Housing & Community Development website that show available housing in all different cities and counties in Maryland. The reporting would examine lead poisoning in Baltimore.  The data on that website would be useful because it has a search tool bar that allows the person looking at the data to see all of the housing that is available for rent that was built before 1950, between 1950 and 1978, and after 1978. In doing so, it is apparent which housing units are more likely to have lead poisoning and which are not—though obviously, all of the units included in the data set would need to be checked through other housing records in order to verify such information. 
      
      It would be good to build the data in a multi-layered map, which tells the reader where there is available housing in Baltimore (each layer would be separated by the time period the housing was built . Then within each layer the user would be able to adjust pricing level for rent—which would pop up the houses available according to their personal criteria. The map would also display which housing units have been deemed to have lead paint in them. That information would come from other records and outside information. In presenting this data the goal is to show the reader the extent to which lead paint is a problem in Baltimore beyond the narrative of a written story with personal accounts. Like the story the Guardian put together, it would give the reader a visual outlook of the issue at hand. In doing so, the reader will be able to contextualize the problem through easily accessible graphics.
